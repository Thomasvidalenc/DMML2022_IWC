## Project description - the idea

In this project, we wanted to detect the difficulty level of the french texts. To be more precise the objective was to predict the difficulty level of the text given in French. Most of the time when someone wants to improve his language skill, they need to read sin order to be familiar with the language. These texts have to be at the readerâ€™s language level. This is why we try to build a model that helps us predict the difficulty level which range between A1 to C2. After the model is created, it can be used in a recommendation system, to recommend texts. If someone is at an A1 level, giving him a text at B2 level is innapropriat because the person won't be able to understand it. This is why it's is important to build a model that helps to detect the difficulty level.
